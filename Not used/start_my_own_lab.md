### Start my lab 

#### Train Students

I am trying to summarize something I’ve been thinking about that is related to how to start my lab and train my students. 

The first idea is to train my first two Ph.D. students very well, and then they can train new students. 

The second idea is to write/select a series of tutorials on doing good research including plotting figures, writing papers, and conducting experiments. 


#### Manage Progress

We should have deadlines and two meetings each week to move the research forward. 

#### Manage Purchasing

Should have a lab-owning account for each website such as Amazon, McMaster Carr, Smooth-On, DigKey, ….

#### Manage Shared Information

Host a google drive to store these useful manuals, datasheets, and software.
