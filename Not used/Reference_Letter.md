## Letter-of-recommendation writing policy

Prof. Stuart is happy to provide letters of recommendation for students so long as there is a standing relationship so that a personalized letter can be written. Generally, this includes students who have worked or volunteered as a graduate or undergraduate student in the laboratory, or students who are in or previously took courses with Prof. Stuart and came to numerous office hours and/or participated in projects. She can also serve as a reference for jobs. If you are not sure, just email and ask!

To request a letter, you must specify the exact opportunity to which you are applying. Typically, Prof. Stuart will only consider requests that are made at least 3 weeks prior to the letter deadline. The first step in making your request is to send Prof. Stuart an email. In that email, provide:

Name and type of opportunity (scholarship, fellowship, grad application, etc.)
An updated resume or CV
Rules and instructions. What is required to submit the recommendation? (Is there an online system, page limits, specific dates needed, etc.)
Bulleted notes on things you’d like me to highlight (contributions to research, performance in a class, etc.). Of course, I will add my own perspective, but you can help me by providing as much information as possible. Don’t be bashful, I will ensure the letter is reasonable and as strong as I can make it.
If you are applying to multiple colleges, fellowships, or scholarships, it is helpful to create a Google Spreadsheet (with hyperlinks and instructions) so I can check them off after submitting them. It helps for the materials to be submitted in a “batch” and for me to receive these requests early so I can get everything in on time. I will do my best not to miss any deadlines. However, it is your responsibility to check to make sure the letter was recorded correctly by the target agency. You should send me multiple reminders me as deadlines approach, if my letters have not yet been filed.
