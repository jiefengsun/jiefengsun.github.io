My name is Jiefeng Sun and I am current a postdoc at CSU with [Prof. Jianguo Zhao](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/me/dr-jianguo-zhao/). I will be a postdoc with [Prof. Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio](https://www.eng.yale.edu/faboratory/) at Yale since Jan. 2023. 

I obtained my Ph.D. student from [Colorado State University](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/me/) in Mechanical Engineering in 2022 under the supervision of Prof. Zhao. My research focuses on the design, modeling, and control of artificial muscles and artificial-muscle-driven robots. I earned my B.S. and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering respectively from Lanzhou University of Technology Lanzhou in 2014 and [Dalian University of Technology (DLUT)](http://en.dlut.edu.cn/) in 2017. 

I am seeking a faculty positioin in academia in the future. Please find my [CV here]({static}/pdfs/CV_Jiefeng_Sun.pdf). Thanks!

 <figcaption> I am selected as a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Riser, Class of 2022. DARPA defines the Risers as, "...up-and-coming standouts in their fields, capable of discovering and leveraging innovative opportunities for technological surprise—the heart of DARPA’s national security mission.". </figcaption>
