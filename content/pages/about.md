My name is Jiefeng Sun and I am an an assistant professor in robotics at Arizona State University.


I was a postdoc with [Prof. Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio](https://www.eng.yale.edu/faboratory/) at Yale University and I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [Colorado State University](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/me/) in Mechanical Engineering in Aug. 2022 under the supervision of [Prof. Jianguo Zhao](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/me/dr-jianguo-zhao/).  I earned my B.S. and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering respectively from Lanzhou University of Technology Lanzhou in 2014 and [Dalian University of Technology (DLUT)](http://en.dlut.edu.cn/) in 2017. Please find my [CV here]({static}/pdfs/CV_Jiefeng_Sun.pdf). 


#### My Lab at ASU
I am always looking for motivated PhD, master, and undergraduate students to join my lab. Please visit our [website](http://sunrobotics.lab.asu.edu/)


The lab's mission is to develop novel robots that are adaptive to different environments, safely interact with humans, and match the adaptivity, robustness, and maneuverability of natural organisms. We will conduct research on robotic actuation and soft robots.

- Artifical muscles
- Soft Robotics
- Modeling and control
- AI integration for robots.



I stopped update research news since 1/1/2024 and **only use this website to document my personal life**.
