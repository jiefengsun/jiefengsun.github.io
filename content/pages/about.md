My name is Jiefeng Sun and I am a postdoc with [Prof. Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio](https://www.eng.yale.edu/faboratory/) at Yale University. My research focuses on the design, modeling, and control of artificial muscles and artificial-muscle-driven robots.

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [Colorado State University](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/me/) in Mechanical Engineering in Aug. 2022 under the supervision of [Prof. Jianguo Zhao](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/me/dr-jianguo-zhao/).  I earned my B.S. and M.S. in Mechanical Engineering respectively from Lanzhou University of Technology Lanzhou in 2014 and [Dalian University of Technology (DLUT)](http://en.dlut.edu.cn/) in 2017. Please find my [CV here]({static}/pdfs/CV_Jiefeng_Sun.pdf). Thanks!
