My name is [Jiefeng Sun](https://search.asu.edu/profile/4837211) and I am an an assistant professor in robotics at Arizona State University. Please find my [CV here]({static}/pdfs/CV_Jiefeng_Sun.pdf). 

#### My Lab at ASU
I am always looking for motivated PhD, master, and undergraduate students to join my lab. Please visit our [website](http://sunrobotics.lab.asu.edu/)






The lab's mission is to develop novel robots that are adaptive to different environments, safely interact with humans, and match the adaptivity, robustness, and maneuverability of natural organisms. We will conduct research on robotic actuation and soft robots.

- Artifical muscles
- Soft Robotics
- Modeling and control
- AI integration for robots.
