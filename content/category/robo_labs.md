I believe that students will be better motivated if they can derive the complicated and tedious equations with advanced tools and can visualize the results with a step-by-step coding guide.

After three years of being the TA and then the intructor of the robotics class, I decided to design four labs/tutorials that using Matlab as a simulation tool to help student simulate finally simulate and control a Puma 560 robot tracking a circle.

Existing toolboxes such as [Robotic Toolbox by Robotics by Peter Corke](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-54413-7) can be used to verify our results. 

Here are what the four labs covered:

1. [Lab 1: Introduction to Matlab and Rotational Matrix Manipulation]({static}/images/teaching/robotics-lab1.html)

	- Learn the structures of data and commands in MATLAB™.
	- Gain knowledge and familiarity with the MATLAB™ interfaces (command prompt, script files, M-files, and functions)
	- Learn the ways to get help with MATLAB™ (help command, html help, Google)
	- Solve some example mathematics problems with MATLAB™, and plot the solutions
	- Practice manipulation of rotation and homogeneous transformation matrix
	- Compare MATLAB™ to your Python, C, FORTRAN, MathCAD, Pascal, BASIC… programming experiences

1. [Lab 2: Position and Velocity Kinematics]({static}/images/teaching/robotics-lab2.html)

	- Symbolic Toolbox
	- Derive forward Position/Velocity Kinematics Programming
	- Foward kinematics of a two link robot. 

1. [Lab 3: Solving Robotics Dynamics]({static}/images/teaching/robotics-lab3.html)

	- Introduction to ODE solving 
	- Use MATLAB ODE solvers to solve sample ODEs. 
	- Solve robotics dynamics (a two link robot and a Puma 560 robot)
